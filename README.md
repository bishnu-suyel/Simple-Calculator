# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator application built with a Java Spring Boot backend and React frontend. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs, and the application demonstrates the integration of Java and React for a full-stack solution.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Backend built with Java Spring Boot.
- Frontend developed with React.
- Communicates through RESTful APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 15+ for the backend.
- npm (Node Package Manager) for the frontend (to manage dependencies).
- Gradle for building the backend project.

### Installation

#### Backend (Java Spring Boot):
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   gradle build
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    gradle bootRun
5. The backend will be available at http://localhost:8080.

#### Frontend (React):
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
3. Start the React app:
    ```bash
     npm run dev
4. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

#### Usage

1. Open the frontend app in your browser (http://localhost:5173).
2. Enter two numbers and select an operation to get the result.
